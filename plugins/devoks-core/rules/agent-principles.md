# Agent Principles

Behavioral principles the AI agent must follow during development work.

---
## [Philosophy] Code Principles

- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** — Specs, types, constants, and schemas must be defined only in the project-designated authoritative files. Do not redefine them elsewhere or replace them with inline literals.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** — If the same logic appears in two or more places, extract it. Eliminate code duplication at the component, hook, and utility levels.
- **Simplicity First (KISS)** — Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature abstraction and over-engineering. Add complexity only when justified.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** — Do not implement features, configurations, error handling, or infrastructure that are not required by the current task. Future requirements are added when they actually arise.
- **Fail Fast (Core Flows)** — In correctness-critical paths, surface errors immediately and stop execution. Prevent large costs at later stages.
- **Explicit Handling (No Implicit Fallback)** — All failures and edge cases must be handled explicitly; silent or implicit fallback is prohibited.
- **Graceful Degradation for Non-Critical Paths** — Failures in non-critical features (analytics, notifications, telemetry) must not block core flows (auth, brew, sensor-ingest). Isolate failure scope; core flows always apply Fail Fast.

## [Pre-Work] Checklist Before Starting

1. **Read Before Touch** — Never suggest modifications without first reading the relevant code. Always read before acting.
2. **Spec First** — Check the relevant PRD/TRD sections before implementation or design-affecting work.
3. **Scope Declaration** — Explicitly state the change scope (which files, which features). If the user explicitly asks to implement, fix, or update a specific scope, treat that request as approval for that scope.
4. **Ask Before Expanding Scope** — Ask before generating code when the request is ambiguous, context is insufficient, more than 3 files may be affected, architecture/API contracts may change, or work outside the requested scope is needed.

## [Done] Definition of Done

5. **Zero Lint/Type Errors** — Work is complete only when there are no lint or TypeScript errors.
6. **Tests Pass** — Relevant tests must pass. If no tests exist, explicitly flag the need for them.
7. **Spec Compliance** — Directly verify that the implementation matches PRD/TRD specs.
8. **No Silent TODOs** — All unresolved TODOs and temporary code must be explicitly flagged before marking work complete.

## [Prohibited] Hard Rules

9. **No Unauthorized Code** — Do not generate code outside the approved or user-requested scope. If scope is unclear, ask first.
10. **No Dev Server Start** — Do not run the dev server (e.g. `pnpm dev`). Assume it is always already running. For mobile UI verification, use feasible lint/type/test/static checks; if simulator or device validation is required, ask the user to verify it.
11. **No Unauthorized Git** — Do not run `git commit` or `git push` without an explicit request.
12. **No Safety Bypass** — Do not bypass safety mechanisms such as `--no-verify`, `--force`, or `--hard`.
13. **No Scope Creep** — Do not refactor, improve, or add features outside the requested scope.
14. **No Destructive Action** — Do not delete files, branches, or other resources without explicit confirmation.

## [Scope Control] Minimal Change Principle

15. **Minimal Change** — Change only what was requested. Do not clean up unrelated code or add comments.
16. **One Task, One Unit** — Keep a single task to a single PR unit. Do not bundle multiple concerns together.
17. **No Premature Abstraction** — Do not create abstractions for future requirements not in the current scope.

## [State & Context] Maintain Consistency

18. **Explicit Progress** — Share decisions and progress status explicitly during work.
19. **Persist Decisions** — Record decisions and feedback that must persist across sessions in memory.
20. **Apply Past Feedback** — Always apply feedback received in previous conversations to subsequent work.
